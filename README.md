# SANDGAME
A physics-based particle simulation implemented in Python using dudraw. This project simulates sand, water, and floor interactions, allowing particles to flow, settle, and interact naturally within a 2D environment.
SandGame Part 2

Overview

SandGame Part 2 is a physics-based particle simulation implemented in Python using dudraw. This project simulates sand, water, and floor interactions, allowing particles to flow, settle, and interact naturally within a 2D environment.

Features

Simulates sand, water, and floor interactions

Uses dudraw for rendering the particle system

Supports natural physics-based movement

User interaction to place different particle types
